# Blog 14: Research Paper and Testing

Sprint 7 weeks 1 consisted of researching and prepare an academic paper. Additionally, each member of the team ran the
generated model reports on their different OS hardware devices.

## Burndown Chart for project research

As the burn-down chart illustrates, we have finished the implementation phase of the project. We will be moving forward
with the research and testing of the project. Our current burn down charts puts as...

## Running the models

Initially, the model report was being generated only on two OS devices which were WindowsPC and macOS. The results from
the generated report obtained from these two devices were different when compared to each other. Therefore, to have a
comprehensive comparison and analysis of the OS devices, we decided to have each individual run the report on their
machine as a team. The objective of running the generated report was to address the speed of completing models on
specific OS devices. Doing this will allow us to discuss further how different OS devices and hardware specifications
can affect the model's performance. In the research paper, we will touch upon this issue and offer some possible
insights and solutions.
