# Blog 4: Sprint 2

working on UI - streamlit
team meeting for sphinx
budget
data collection and compilation spectogram

This week we started Sprint 2, the bi-weekly schedule still stands so this will be part 1 of our two week sprint.
For this first week of this sprint we have worked on the user interface, UI, working on documentation, completing data collection, and team meeting for the Sphinx program.

The UI that we have been working on will be the page that the users will see and be able to interact with.
In this page, users will be able to look at the all of the algorithms that we have trained and have the ability to choose the dataset and algorithm for on the spot results with graphs and classification results.

We also been working on the SRS document, this week we have completed the schedule. This will serve as the schedule for the entire Spring semester.
This schedule will be followed very strictly as this will the grading scale for our final deliverable and grade for the course.
We also want to do this project justice and create something we are all proud of.

Another part of the SRS that we have completed is the budget. For this project we had to create two different budgets,
the first one is creating the budget that our final deliverable and the other budget that we created is if we were an actual company.

We also are in the process of compiling the data for our AI programs. We are in the process of adding files to "librosa" so that the audio can be turned into an image for training and testing.
For the images, we are completing the cropping and annotations for the images. The data that we have collected from the public online datasets, we have to crop them to show only the image so that the AI does not get odd assumptions.
In addition to the images being cropped, they have to be configured to greyscale to ensure that the data is as unbias as possible.

Since this is only the first week, we still have some tasks that need to be completed.
These include creating a wrapper class that handles various procedures needed for dealing with datasets, begin implementation of the interchangeability of algorithms, and finish redesigning the SRS to reflect the sections instead of the sprints.
Although these tasks are not completed, they have been started and will be completed before Sprint 2 is completed.
