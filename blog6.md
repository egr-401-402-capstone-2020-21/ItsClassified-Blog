# Blog 6: Coming Back and New Sprint

This week is the first week back after the winter break. The team got back into the grove of things very quickly.
During the week we created story points and assigned them to tasks we have for this sprint, and will for all future sprints.
The team has also began the implementation of two different AI models as well as starting to improve code from previous implementations, and work on improving the look and functionality of the UI we currently have.
The last thing that we worked on this week is the implementation of two AI models.

## Story Points

Story Points are similar to difficulty level, the differences between each level or amount of points shows the amount of time and work that someone or a group of people should take on a specific task.
These tasks, that are shown in our weekly schedule, are given story points by the whole team at the beginning of the sprint.
In our version of the story points each story point "size" will have a different amount of points associated with it and depending on the amount of points that are on the board, that is how many points each person will have to complete as a minimum for the sprint.
The picture below shows the different denominations of each "size".

## Improving our Code

The month before winter break, we had a decent amount of code for out UI and one machine learning algorithm that we have, but this week some of the team went in and made some changes to the code.
The changes that we made to clean up the code were reducing the logic, improving readability, and improving the comments. Doing any of this does not make the AI run any faster or makes it more effect, all this is for is for convention and for us as the programmers.
Having clean code by simplifying logic and increasing the readability helps us for when we come back to the code when we come back to double check all of our work.

## Updates to the UI

Another thing that we have done is update the UI. Before we started working on the UI this week, we just had the basics of the UI up and running but we have also added two key features that will help users understand what is going on while they wait for the results.
The first thing that we added is a progressing line represents the amount of objects processed by the AI models as well as how much time has passed. The other task that we have started on this week is the graphical output for the UI.
Our vision for the final output of the UI is once the AI model is chosen and the dataset is as well, there will be a graphical output of the differences between algorithms. Below is a sample of what the finished product might look like.

## Implementation of AI Models

Before the break, we had already started the implementation of one of the AI we plan on doing, and this week we are continuing to work on that model as well as start the implementation of that one.
We had already been working on Support Vector Machine, SVM, and now this sprint we are starting another model called Random Forests.
The way that Random Forests work is by using several different decision trees on various sub-examples of a given dataset. Then by averaging out the results, the model's prediction is achieved.
Below is a visual representation of the decision making of a Random Forest algorithm.
