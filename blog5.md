# Blog 5: Sprint 2 Week 2


This week was the second week for Sprint 2.
During this second week of this Sprint we completed the basic elements of the UI, worked on dataset manipulation, completed the model serializer and reserializer, and started working on our final presentation package.
We are in the process of the implementation of the AI algorithm, Support Vector Machine or SVM.

# User Interface

Currently the UI is incomplete as of the final deliverable, but the basics are completed.
In the current version of the user interface, it has two drop down menus that will allow the user to choose the dataset and the algorithm. There are also boxes that can be checked to manipulate the dataset such as turning the images to greyscale.
Currently we are in the process of creating the SVM which will be added to the UI as an option for possible algorithms to be ran.

# Dataset manipulation

As discussed in the last blog, making sure that the dataset is as unbias as possible is extremely important when training any AI algorithm. Taking note of this, making sure that when data is fed into the AI algorithm, it as clean as possible.
Doing this was one of the tasks that we completed this week. The specific manipulations that we did to images were make them greyscale, crop the image, and resizing. Turning the image greyscale is important to getting the most uniform colors through the algorithm.
Cropping the images is important too, it limits the amount of unnecessary background "noise" that could mess up the training of the AI.
The resizing of the images is less for the AI, and more for the users and developers. This makes it that everyone who is looking at the dataset, can clearly see what the image is capturing, instead of having a small image that is hard to see.
We have been able to mass update datasets by converting them to greyscale and resizing using Python.

# Presentation Package

This week is the last week of finals and for this class, we have to do another presentation. This presentation will include what we have accomplished and what we have coming up for next semester.
