# Blog 2: Setting Up and Starting Sprint 1


This week we did some set up for the upcoming weeks and the sprints that we will be completing.
We have created a Trello Board and added tasks to be completed. This Trello board will be used to keep all of our tasks that have been completed, in progress, and tasks that will be completed.

We have also created an application programming interface, API, documentation of our code. As the `Documentation` branch indicates the team will iteratively be adding documentation during each iteration.
The team is currently using ReadTheDocs to host public documentation as the project develops. The current documentation build can be seen [here](https://its-classified.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
There is currently only one entry under the API section of the documentation, the ModelWrapper class and package. However, as the team updates the GitHub repository the documentation on ReadTheDocs will also update to reflect the current status of the repository.
The team is using a software package called Sphinx to generate the documentation based off of the documentation the team provides in their source code.

We are also in the process of modifying the SRS document as it does not reflect our project as well as we want it to.
Modifying this document now is not only going to help us reassure our understanding of the project, but also express the differences of the new project to our client and technical advisor.

In addition to this, we are also doing lots of research and analysis for the datasets and classification models that we will be using in the course of this project.
Specifically this week we are analyzing the UrbanSounds dataset and identifying datasets for image-recognition. After we are finished analyzing, we will prepare the datasets for training and testing of the AI algorithms that we will be using.
We are also comprising a list of possible Ai algorithms that we will be using. Some that we are most likly to include are SVM, Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network.
