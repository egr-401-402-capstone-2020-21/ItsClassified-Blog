# Blog 1: Merging of SoundBytes and Here's Your Sign



Hello! Welcome to the blog for Its Classified, the new AI comparison team! The only change between this team and the two other teams, "Here's Your Sign" and "SoundBytes" is that instead of being two teams focused on sound and images, we are one big team consisting of all members from both teams.

This week, after our final training with our Technical Advisor, we had a realization that our teams were doing very similar things thus, we decided that we were going to combine our teams and projects. With the merging of groups we also had to merge our documents. 
The project that we came up with as a massive group is a mixture of both of our original projects. From the SoundBytes team, we wanted to keep the idea of being able to make something that can switch between multiple AI algorithms, and from the Here's Your Sign team, we wanted to keep the final deliverable of a research paper comparing all the algorithms that we plan on working on. 
After brain storming and talking to our client we decided that we are going to make a program that will contain all of the algorithms that we plan on comparing. Within this program, a user will be able to switch between algorithms and run tests on the spot. We will also be creating a document that will contain all the data, and an in depth analysis of the algorithms with suggestions based off the results we gather. 
The end goal still hasn't changed, we want to compare the algorithms and determine what makes one better in certain situations. 

This week we worked on updating the "Requirement Specification" portion of our document, and we also completed the "Risks" portion of the document. These portions of the System Requirement and Specification document are vital to moving forward. 
The "Requirement Specification" part of the document contains the system architecture, software specifications, interface specification, component specification, data specification, and algorithm specification, along with some other general specifications to help minimize merge conflicts in the future. 
We had already completed this portion of the document separately as SoundBytes and Here's Your Sign but with the combination of our teams, an update was required to ensure that our new deliverable and combination of our teams was reflected in the document. 
The "Risk" portion of the document is the current and future risks that could potentially harm us, or the public when taking on this project. One of the biggest problems that we thought of was "since we are combining so late and modifying the final deliverable, will we still be able to finish our project by April 2021?".
The answer is simple, yet it will require that all seven of us are on task. But we do believe that we are able to create this hot swappable AI program and provide good analysis by April. We believe that if all of us stay on task and get everything done when it needs to be done, we will be able to finish without worrying too much about the deadline. 

The first algorithm that we plan on creating is Support Vector Machine, or SVM. Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning model that analyzes data used for classification and regression analysis. SVM uses the statistics of support vectors and clusters similar data together. 
SVM has multiple parameters that allows the algorithm to be more accurate, these parameters are know as gamma, C, and kernel. 
Gamma is the kernel coefficient for RBF, poly, and sigmoid kernels that determines how far the influence of a single data point reaches when computing decision boundaries. 
C is the regularization parameter that controls the tightness of fit, this also effects the modelâ€™s ability to generalize when presented with new data. 
Lastly, the kernel is the type of kernel that is used when compiling the algorithm, such as linear, RBF, poly, and sigmoid. 

The SRS document that we are building as we continue this project reflects only SVM, as our development methodology will be an agile approach. But as we continue to add more AI algorithms to the interface, we will add those algorithms to the document.
