# Blog 16: Research Paper and Testing

Sprint 8 weeks 2 consisted of writing an academic paper, preparing presentation slides for the design showcase, and
finishing testing. After speaking to several engineering professors, we have decided to choose a format and began
writing the draft. As the burn-down chart illustrates, we are continuing with the research and testing portion of the
project. We are currently ahead of our ideal progress and on track to completing our remaining tasks.

## Preparing For Design Showcase

Besides working on the research paper, some team members prepared the two required presentation slides for the virtual
design showcase. The engineering school will have a virtual design showcase in which the freshmen, junior, and senior
class will be presenting their projects to the public. In this event, each team will be giving a presentation of their
projects. The first presentation slides that we worked on consisted of sharing and informing the general public about
the overall project. And if people wanted to go into a private room with each team, the second slide gives them a
detailed explanation and demo of the completed project. In addition to these two task, each team member also worked on 
the individual research paper.
